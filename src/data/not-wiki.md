The second (and main) layer of the narrative is the correspondence between the two characters, which is literally carried out in the margins of this "library" book. The printing is so high quality that it literally feels like the pages were written in pens and pencils. In this same correspondence, as I understand it, the plot develops.  
And the third layer is the many postcards, letters, documents, and maps enclosed in the book as bookmarks, which the characters exchange and which also complete and develop the story. The map in the fourth photo is drawn on a real (!) napkin, you can zoom in.
